## Project Summary:
In late 2021 I had an itch to scratch, I wanted to visit some friends around the western United States. Although it seemed like a waste of gas to make the trip without extracting any data from it or expanding any of my skills (other than driving or sleeping in my car.) So I decided to try and build an 'on the fly' data capture, processing, and training system that would allow me to train a 'self driving car' on the roadtrip so that by the end I could let it do the driving for me. 

Well, as it seems to go with all projects, when time and budgetary constraints part the clouds of blind optimism, the scope must be whittled down. So the project ended up being the creation of a simple self-driving data capture system that tested my ability to build real-world efficient, redundant, data capture, data processing, AI training systems. 

It was an incredibly fun project and I'm happy I had the time and energy to complete it, below I've attached the data from the +2,000 mile roadtrip as well as links to the 4 youtube videos I created about the project. 

Have a great day!

### Pickled Dataset Link: <https://archive.org/details/road_angle_data_master>

Dataset Description:
* ~1.4M Image & Steering Angle Value Pairs
* Half Flipped Horizontally For Equal Representation of Angles
* 10-15% Image Data Augmentation (Brightness, Resolution, Colors, etc.)

Repo Contains Code For:
* Running Similar Raspberry PI Data Capture System 
* Downloading, Processing, and Training Keras CNN on Data

Video Explanation Links:
I would love to have build out an exhaustive explanation similar to my other repos, however, at this point I don't have the time. So I will link 4 youtube videos where I did my best to highlight the project in a fun and engaging way.
